GENERAL
=======
  * Improve the general workflow
  -- FRect class
  -- Basic steering behaviors
  * Jumping =)
  * Firing and shooting
  -- Collision avoidance
  -- Flocking
  * Watching

Steering Behaviors
==================
  * Document the functions
  -- Check out all the bugs and strange behaviors. purse_evade?

Jumping
=======
  -- Main character jumping
  * ai jumping! =S!
  * landing path jumping for ai, when wandering it just wander,
    when pursuing or evading jumps every thing jumpable in the way

Firing and shooting
===================
  -- firing something from ai
  -- first person shooting with angles
  * granade previsions

Collision Avoidance
===================
  -- FRECT CLASS!
  -- Semi collision avoidance for the main character
  -- Restructurate Rect Class for positioning in the middle
  -- Collision avoidance for ia

Flocking
========
  -- Do flocking

First Version
=============
  -- Wandering
  -- Separation and Flocking
  -- Shooting with angle
- * AI Jumping
  -- Collision Detection
  -- Collision Avoidance
  -- Hitting
  -- Key handling for main character
  -- Blending with arbitration

Second Version
==============
  -- Hitting, animation-effects, harming.
  -- Hitting mass coeficient
- * Throwing out of the stage
  -- Enemies hit me and shoot me
  -- A* and path finding  #Something about path finding, A*
  -- State Machine        #Something about decision making
  * AI JUMPING!
  * Improve jumping, jump over objects, object's normals

Third Version
=============
  -- Sound and hearing implementation
  * Smelling?
  * Viewport refactor / extending the map
  * Waypoints
  * Finishing up: Video, Game-over design, a Menu?, bullet explotions
